# The Project

This project is a demonstration of front end skills, for a basic news news site. This site is hosted at: https://anew-pjce.netlify.app/articles.

"Anew" is an imaginary news website, where users can look through and read articles, as well as being able to post comments, and like/dislike articles. Built in react, the site uses no component frameworks like bootstrap/MUI as I wanted to improve my own personal html & css skills.

The website is currently designed for solely mobile devices. Desktop works, however the formatting is not designed for it. This was due to the limited time I had to develop the project while on the northcoders bootcamp.

It connects to an API hosted at https://pjce-nc-news.onrender.com/api, the project for which can also be found on github at: https://github.com/patrick-jc-evans/PJCE-NC-News.
